#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
1. what `First Class` functions are
  
 A 'First Class' function refers to its ability to be treated as a first-class object (also referred to as first-class citizen) because it supports all of the operations that other objects are allowed.
 This means that a First Class function can be:
- *Stored in a variable*
- *Passed as an argument to a function*
- *Returned as a value by functions*
- *Be stored in a data structure (i.e. an array)*

    
2. how this concept applies in JS.
3. what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
4. Bonus: give examples for each explanation
