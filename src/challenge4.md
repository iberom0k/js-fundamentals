#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
1. **What `First Class` functions are**
  
   A 'First Class' function refers to its ability to be treated as a first-class object (also referred to as first-class citizen) because it supports all of the operations that other objects are allowed.
    
2. **How this concept applies in JS.**

   In JS, a First Class function can be:
  - *Stored in a variable*
  - *Passed as an argument to a function*
  - *Returned as a value by functions*
  - *Be stored in a data structure (i.e. an array)*
  
3. **What the difference is between declaring a function and calling it**
   
   Bonus: give examples for each explanation
